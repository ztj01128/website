 I am currently in my third year at the University of Washington, with a double major in Community, Environment and Planning (CEP) and Geography: Data Science. My passions in urban planning and mapping were in large part born out of the variety of cities and environments that I have experienced in my life. During my time at the UW, I was able to pursue these interests through the flexibility of the CEP program, and gained knowledge in planning, GIS, data analysis, as well as global migration and transnational economic development. 
Outside of the classroom, I am interested in traveling, good foods, public transportation, as well as a bit of a car enthusiast. I have also been an all-star (competitive) cheerleader for the past four years. 
This E-Portfolio documents what I have achieved and learned during my time in CEP, as well as my Senior Project. As I have not quite graduated from the UW, just yet, this website will be a “living document” as I continue my academic journey.
