                "The Individualized Study Plan (ISP) is the most important planning document that you will write in CEP. It is the program's way of ensuring that you are intentional about your education, and that you use the freedom the major offers to chart your own educational path. 

We want you to chart out your next two years in a way that is consistent with your goals as well as your graduation requirements. In this manner, the ISP is both an academic road map, laying out the courses you plan to take and the activities you plan to engage in, and a written reflection of your educational aspirations and accomplishments. 

Your plan will evolve during your time in the major. You should think of the ISP as a living document, regularly revising it top reflect the changes you make as you discover new opportunities and interests".
