                "The Individualized Study Plan (ISP) is the most important planning document that you will write in CEP.
                It is the program's way of ensuring that you are intentional about your education, and that you use the
                freedom the major offers to chart your own educational path.

                We want you to chart out your next two years in a way that is consistent with your goals as well as your
                graduation requirements. In this manner, the ISP is both an academic road map, laying out the courses
                you plan to take and the activities you plan to engage in, and a written reflection of your educational
                aspirations and accomplishments.

                Your plan will evolve during your time in the major. You should think of the ISP as a living document,
                regularly revising it top reflect the changes you make as you discover new opportunities and interests".

                the convergence of geography, art, and visualization. The goal is to encourage students to reflect on
                something special in their lives in Seattle, and engage with various methods and mediums to best convey
                and 'visualize' their experiences. The course will explore new creative possibilities of visualization
                and mapping, including a collage art and coding for a graph, that will help to produce new artistic and
                spatial knowledge about Seattle.

                        I took this course as a part of the Urban Design & Planning minor. This course was at the center
                        of my
                        two interests in urban planning and GIS, with a focus on applying GIS tools in urban planning
                        settings,
                        I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the various tools we utilized, as well as potential
                        issues
                        that can be addressed using GIS.
